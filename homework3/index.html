        <h1>Frozen</h1>

        <p>
            Mmm, if I could melt your heart<br>
            Mmm, if I could melt your heart 
        </p>

        <p>
            Okay, what's the addy?<br>
            All the lights are flashing<br>
            I'm surprised I barely made it, took two shots, I barely taste it<br>
            Red cups, I keep passing<br>
            Rolling peaks and valleys<br>
            Better focus, concentrating, took too much, I'm levitatin'
        </p>

        <p> 
            Open up the gates, I feel close enough to heaven<br>
            To go, to stay, to leave, to pray<br>
            C-cast out in the rain, guess they didn't like my confession<br>
            It's no mistake, I know it's just a bad religion
        </p>

        <p>
            Whoa, whoa<br>
            Don't blow my high, don't calm me down<br>
            Don't text me back, don't call me now<br>
            Whoa, whoa<br>
            It's something in the water, yeah, I just came by to wash it down
        </p>

        <p>
            Mmm (down, down), if I could melt your heart<br>
            Mmm (right, right, right, right), if I could melt your heart
        </p>    

        <p>
            Open up the gates, I feel close enough to heaven<br>

            Mmm (whoa, whoa)<br>
            Don't blow my high, don't calm me down<br>
            Don't text me back, don't call me now<br>

            Mmm, if I could melt your heart<br>
            Mmm, we'd never be apart
